Project Overview

This project leverages the xAPI-Edu-Data dataset to analyze and visualize students' academic performance and behavioral patterns. The goal is to provide insights into how various factors, such as gender, topics, and parental satisfaction, influence student outcomes. The analysis includes creating detailed dashboards to support educational decision-making and student performance improvements.


Technologies Used

Tools: Tableau


Dataset: xAPI-Edu-Data

Visualizations: Interactive dashboards for performance and student behavior analysis


Data Source
The data used in this project is sourced from the xAPI-Edu-Data dataset, which contains detailed information about student grades, behavioral metrics, and demographic details. It is publicly available and widely used for educational data analysis.

Dataset Details:

Source: Kaggle - xAPI-Edu-Data
Key Features:
gender: Gender of students
GradeID: Grade levels (e.g., G-02, G-08)
StageID: Educational stages (e.g., Lower, Middle School)
Topic: Subject names (e.g., IT, Science)
raisedhands: Frequency of hands raised in class
VisITedResources: Count of visited resources
Discussion: Level of class participation
ParentschoolSatisfaction: Parental satisfaction with the school


Project Features
Dashboards

Student Performance Dashboard:

Visualizes key metrics like student grades, class participation, and resource usage.
Displays demographic breakdowns, including gender and birthplace distributions.


Performance Analysis Dashboard:

Highlights relationships between academic performance and behavioral indicators (e.g., resource visits, discussions).
Tracks overall satisfaction with parental involvement and absenteeism rates.


Analysis Highlights

Performance vs. Behavior:
Correlations between grades, resource usage, and participation levels.
Behavioral trends across different grades and subjects.

Demographic Insights:
Gender-based and regional performance variations.
Attendance patterns in relation to student performance.
